# Bus-checker

A front end react implementation quering the TFL api to check the next busses of a certain line to arrive at a certain stop

Technologies:
 - React
 - React query
 - Vite
 - TailwindCSS

Motivated by the fact that I live between two bus stops. One stop where a bus never comes on time and one where it's always does. Helping me to answer the question: 'Which stop should I go to?'

Todo : 
- List overlap detection
- Decouple the selection UI from results loading
- Add a map to see what stop you are close to
